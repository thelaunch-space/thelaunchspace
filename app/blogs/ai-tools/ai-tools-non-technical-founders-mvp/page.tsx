            The short answer: <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Claude Code for building, Bolt.new for prototyping, Cursor for editing, Convex for your backend, and Make.com for automation.</span> That is the stack we have used to ship 65 projects in 14 months as a non-developer. This guide explains why these five tools, how they work together, and how to get productive with them in weeks rather than months.

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If you have searched for AI tools to build your MVP, you have probably encountered two types of content: tech influencer lists that name 20 tools without explaining which to actually use, or developer-focused reviews that assume you can code. Neither helps a non-technical founder who needs to make a real decision.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We are writing from a different perspective. At <a href="/" className="text-accent-blue hover:underline">thelaunch.space</a>, we have shipped production software without writing traditional code. Not demos. Not prototypes. Real products with paying users. The stack we recommend below is what we actually use.

          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-4">Why the AI Tool Landscape Feels Overwhelming</h2>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The AI coding tools market has exploded. According to <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/artificial-intelligence-code-tools-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-accent-blue hover:underline">Mordor Intelligence</a>, it hit $7.4 billion in 2025 and is growing at over 24% annually. The <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-accent-blue hover:underline">2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a> found that 84% of developers now use or plan to use AI tools, with 51% using them daily.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-border-color/30 border border-border-color rounded-xl p-8 my-10 text-center">
            <p className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-2">51%</p>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-base text-text-secondary">of professional developers now use AI tools daily</p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The result is a chaotic landscape. ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Bolt.new, Replit, GitHub Copilot, V0, Windsurf, Lovable, and dozens more. Each claims to be revolutionary. Each has different strengths. As a non-technical founder, you have no way to evaluate which claims are marketing and which are real.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The confusion we see most often: founders try one tool, hit a wall, assume AI tools do not work, and go back to searching for a technical cofounder. The problem was not the technology. It was using the wrong tool for the job, or using tools in isolation instead of as a stack.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-border-color my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-4">The Curated Tool Stack (From 65 Projects)</h2>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            After shipping 65 projects, we have settled on five core tools. Each serves a specific purpose, and they work together as a system. This is not a list of everything that exists. It is what we actually use and recommend.
          </p>

          <div className="border-l-4 border-accent-blue pl-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-primary font-medium leading-relaxed">
              The goal is not to learn 20 tools. It is to master five that cover 90% of what you need to build.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Claude Code: The Primary Building Tool</h3>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-accent-blue hover:underline">Claude Code</a> is an agentic coding assistant from Anthropic. Unlike ChatGPT or regular Claude, it does not just generate code snippets. It reads your entire codebase, edits files directly, runs commands, and manages your project like a junior developer would.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            What makes it different for non-technical founders: you describe what you want in plain English, and it builds it. Not copy-paste code blocks that you have to figure out where to put. Actual working features in your actual project.
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-4 my-8">
            <div className="bg-border-color/20 rounded-xl p-5">
              <p className="text-text-primary font-semibold mb-1">Full project context</p>
              <p className="text-text-secondary text-base leading-relaxed">Claude Code sees your entire codebase, not just the file you are working on. It understands how pieces connect.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-border-color/20 rounded-xl p-5">
              <p className="text-text-primary font-semibold mb-1">Executes commands</p>
              <p className="text-text-secondary text-base leading-relaxed">It can run tests, install packages, start servers, and deploy. You describe the outcome, it handles the steps.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-border-color/20 rounded-xl p-5">
              <p className="text-text-primary font-semibold mb-1">Persistent memory</p>
              <p className="text-text-secondary text-base leading-relaxed">It remembers your project across sessions. No re-explaining your architecture every time.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Cost:</span> $20/month for Claude Pro (includes Claude Code access). This is our highest-ROI tool spend.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Bolt.new: Rapid Prototyping and Quick Wins</h3>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <a href="https://bolt.new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-accent-blue hover:underline">Bolt.new</a> is a browser-based AI builder. You describe what you want, and it generates a full working app with frontend, backend connections, and one-click deployment. No installations. No setup. Everything runs in your browser.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We use Bolt.new differently than Claude Code. Bolt is for speed. When we need to test an idea quickly, show a client a concept, or build a simple tool that does not need to scale, Bolt gets us from zero to deployed in hours rather than days.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-border-color/30 border border-border-color rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-text-primary font-medium">Think of Bolt.new as the sketch pad and Claude Code as the workshop. Bolt validates ideas fast. Claude Code builds production systems.</p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Cost:</span> Free tier available. Pro at $25/month for more generations and features.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Cursor: The AI-Native Code Editor</h3>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Cursor is a code editor built around AI assistance. If you have heard of VS Code, Cursor is essentially VS Code with AI deeply integrated. It autocompletes code, explains what code does, and lets you edit files by describing changes in natural language.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Why we use Cursor alongside Claude Code: Claude Code is great for building features from scratch. Cursor is better for understanding existing code, making targeted edits, and learning what your codebase does. When we need to modify something specific or debug an issue, Cursor is faster than explaining the full context to Claude Code.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Cost:</span> Free tier with limited AI calls. Pro at $20/month for unlimited.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Convex: The Backend That Just Works</h3>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <a href="https://www.convex.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-accent-blue hover:underline">Convex</a> is a backend-as-a-service platform that handles your database, real-time subscriptions, file storage, and serverless functions. What makes it different from alternatives like Supabase: everything is TypeScript-native and real-time by default.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We switched to Convex after using Supabase on earlier projects. The difference for non-technical founders: Convex is simpler to reason about. Your schema lives in your code, not in a separate dashboard. Real-time updates happen automatically without configuring WebSockets or subscriptions. When you change data, every connected user sees it instantly with under 50ms latency.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Convex also integrates seamlessly with AI-assisted development. Because everything is TypeScript, Claude Code and Cursor understand your entire backend. No context-switching between SQL dashboards and code editors. No connection pooling issues or cold starts. It is built for the "vibe coding" workflow where you describe what you want and let AI build it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Cost:</span> Generous free tier with unlimited projects. Pro at $25/month when you scale. Unlike Supabase which limits you to 2 free projects, Convex lets you build as many prototypes as you want without hitting paywalls.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Make.com: Automation Without Code</h3>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Make.com (formerly Integromat) connects your apps and automates workflows. When someone submits a form, send them an email and add them to a spreadsheet. When a payment completes, create an account and notify Slack. These integrations would normally require custom code. Make lets you build them visually.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We use Make.com for everything that connects systems: CRM updates, notification workflows, data syncing, scheduled reports. It saves us from building integration code that is tedious and error-prone.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Cost:</span> Free tier with 1,000 operations/month. Core plan at $10.59/month for 10,000 operations.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-border-color my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-4">Use Case Mapping: Which Tool When</h2>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The most common mistake we see: founders try to do everything in one tool. Each tool has a sweet spot. Knowing which to reach for saves hours of frustration.

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We are not going to pretend this is instant. AI tools are powerful, but they have a learning curve. Here is what we have observed across our work and the founders we have coached:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-border-color/30 border border-border-color rounded-xl p-8 my-10 text-center">
            <p className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-2">3 to 4 weeks</p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Week 1:</span> Learning to prompt effectively. The biggest shift is learning how to describe what you want. AI tools are powerful but literal. Vague prompts get vague results. You will spend this week learning what level of detail produces good outputs.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Week 2:</span> Building your first complete project. Pick something small but real. Not a tutorial project. Something you actually want to exist. You will hit walls, learn to debug with AI help, and start understanding how the pieces connect.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Week 3-4:</span> Building faster, recognizing patterns. By now you know which tool to reach for. You recognize common problems and their solutions. You are not copying tutorials. You are building with intention.
          </p>

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-primary font-medium leading-relaxed">
              The learning curve is not about memorizing syntax or commands. It is about developing intuition for what AI can do and how to communicate effectively with it.

            This is not an apples-to-apples comparison. A developer brings experience, judgment, and speed that AI tools cannot fully replace. But for an early-stage founder validating ideas and building MVPs, the cost difference is transformative. You can afford to build and test multiple products for the monthly cost of one hour of developer time.

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            AI tools are not a solution for everything. After 65 projects, here is where we consistently recommend hiring specialists:

              <p className="text-text-secondary text-base leading-relaxed">AI tools can build web apps and progressive web apps. True native iOS/Android apps with platform-specific features still need mobile developers. If your product requires deep hardware integration, camera access, or offline-first functionality, plan to hire.</p>

              <p className="text-text-secondary text-base leading-relaxed">AI tools can implement standard patterns. Custom machine learning models, complex recommendation systems, or novel algorithms require specialists who understand the math, not just the code.</p>

              <p className="text-text-primary font-semibold mb-1">High-stakes security and compliance</p>
              <p className="text-text-secondary text-base leading-relaxed">Healthcare, finance, and other regulated industries have compliance requirements that need expert review. AI tools do not understand HIPAA or SOC 2. Use them for building, but have specialists audit.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-4">Getting Started: Your First Week</h2>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If you are ready to start, here is a practical week one roadmap:
          </p>

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-text-secondary text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
            <li><span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Day 1-2:</span> Sign up for Claude Pro ($20). Install Claude Code following <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-accent-blue hover:underline">the official docs</a>. Build something trivial to get familiar with the workflow.</li>
            <li><span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Day 3:</span> Create a Convex account (free). Set up a basic database table following their quick start. Connect it to a simple app using Claude Code.</li>
            <li><span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Day 4-5:</span> Use Bolt.new to prototype a real idea you have. Deploy it. Share the link with someone for feedback.</li>
            <li><span className="text-text-primary font-semibold">Day 6-7:</span> Start your actual MVP. Define the simplest version that proves your idea works. Begin building with Claude Code and Convex.</li>
          </ol>

          <div className="border-l-4 border-accent-blue pl-6 my-8">
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-primary font-medium leading-relaxed">
              The goal of week one is not to build a complete product. It is to prove to yourself that you can build. That confidence compounds.
            </p>
          </div>

          <hr className="border-border-color my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The AI tool landscape is overwhelming because most content is written by people who have not shipped real products with these tools. They are reviewing, not practicing. We are sharing what works because we use it every day.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Five tools. $100-140/month. Three to four weeks to get productive. That is the reality of building as a non-technical founder in 2026. Not easy, but possible. And much more accessible than it was even a year ago.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The bottleneck is no longer whether you can afford to build. It is whether you know what to build and can communicate it clearly. That is a strategy problem, and strategy is exactly what domain-expert founders are good at.
