# Todo — thelaunch.space Landing Page + Blog

Last updated: 2026-02-16

## Priority: High
- [ ] **`/build-your-ai-team` pitch page** — BRAINSTORMING IN PROGRESS. Replaces current agent showcase with ICP-focused landing page that explains the organic content use case, introduces agents by job (not name), shows contextualized proof numbers, CTAs into Launch Control. See `.context/build-your-ai-team-landing.md` for full brainstorm state.
- [ ] **Launch Control FTUE** — Add contextual first-visit labels to dashboard sections (scoreboard, timeline, feed, agents) so cold visitors understand what they're looking at. Part of the pitch → proof flow. Details in `.context/build-your-ai-team-landing.md`.
- [ ] **Verify Daily Timeline times** — hardcoded in `lib/launch-control-types.ts`. Ask Partha to confirm they match actual VPS cron jobs.
- [ ] **Fix Scoreboard baseline** — remove hardcoded `5*3` hours / `5*180` cost, zero out or make data-dependent
- [ ] **Create `.context/thelaunch-space-icp.md`** — referenced by `build-your-ai-team-landing.md` and `launch-control-frontend-spec.md` but doesn't exist. Document the ICP profile (domain-expert founders, 35-50, $100K-$2M services businesses).
- [ ] Build out free tools pages (`/tools/[tool-slug]`)

## Priority: Medium
- [ ] Add Vitest + React Testing Library for lead capture flow
- [ ] Add basic error boundary component
- [ ] Clean up Netlify: remove duplicate site (`thelaunch-space-v2` if still present)
- [ ] Fix branch protection: disable "require status checks" (deploy previews not configured, checks always fail)
- [ ] Delete test brief from Convex dev (`jd7efw8gxba5hc5c3jqvmkwvs9817nw6`)

## Priority: Low
- [ ] Consider next/image for optimized image loading
- [ ] Add loading skeleton for particle effects init
- [ ] Consider Netlify deploy previews for PR review (currently using local preview)
- [ ] Regenerate Valmiki avatar using updated sage prompt (design-system-v2.md)
