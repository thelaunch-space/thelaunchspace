# Todo — thelaunch.space Landing Page + Blog

Last updated: 2026-02-15

## Priority: High
- [ ] **Partha historical data backfill** — waiting for Partha to push ALL Google Sheets data to prod Convex DB (message sent)
- [ ] **Fix Scoreboard baseline** — remove hardcoded `5*3` hours / `5*180` cost, zero out or make data-dependent
- [ ] Build out free tools pages (`/tools/[tool-slug]`)

## Priority: Medium
- [ ] Add Vitest + React Testing Library for lead capture flow
- [ ] Add basic error boundary component
- [ ] Clean up Netlify: remove duplicate site (`thelaunch-space-v2` if still present)
- [ ] Fix branch protection: disable "require status checks" (deploy previews not configured, checks always fail)
- [ ] Delete test brief from Convex dev (`jd7efw8gxba5hc5c3jqvmkwvs9817nw6`)

## Priority: Low
- [ ] Consider next/image for optimized image loading
- [ ] Add loading skeleton for particle effects init
- [ ] Consider Netlify deploy previews for PR review (currently using local preview)
- [ ] Regenerate Valmiki avatar using updated sage prompt (design-system-v2.md)
