## Background: How We Got Here

### Session 1 (Feb 16) — The Launch Control Problem

We walked the Launch Control dashboard as an ICP (domain-expert founder, 35-50, $100K-$2M services business). The diagnosis:

- **"Launch Control" means nothing to cold visitors.** Product name, not benefit.
- **Agent names are alienating.** Parthasarathi, Vibhishana, Vyasa — impressive but unfamiliar.
- **Numbers without context.** "47q, 12b, 3p" is meaningless without framing.
- **Dashboard is proof, not pitch.** Fantastic "proof of work" but missing the translation layer.

Core realization: **Launch Control is proof, not pitch.** The funnel was broken:

```
LinkedIn post → Dashboard (proof) ← no context, ICP bounces
```

### Session 2 (Feb 16, continued) — The Evolution

Key shifts:
1. **This is a service page, not a product page.** We're not selling a dashboard. We're selling "your content marketing, handled by AI agents, for $200/month to start."
2. **Launch Control becomes hidden proof**, not the front door. Secondary CTA for the curious.
3. **Real pricing, real timeline.** $200 POC for month 1. 4-week engagement model.
4. **Agent pages become Pokemon/WWE stat cards.** Scannable, shareable, "wow" factor.
5. **URL: `/hire-your-24x7-team`** — emphasizes always-on, broader than SEO, expandable to future workstreams.

---

## URL Decision

| Option | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| `/build-your-ai-team` (old) | Too vague. "Build" implies DIY. We're selling a done-for-you service. |
| `/hire-ai-seo-team` | Too narrow. Locks us into SEO only. |
| `/hire-ai-content-team` | Better, but still content-only. |
| `/ai-seo-team` | Too short. Doesn't convey action. |
| **`/hire-your-24x7-team`** | **Winner. "24x7" is the hook — your team never sleeps. Broad enough for SEO, content, ops, anything. "Hire" frames it as a service, not a tool.** |

### Why "24x7" works for the ICP
- Founders are tired of being the bottleneck. "24x7" directly promises relief.
- It's memorable and tweetable: "I hired a 24/7 AI team for $200."
- It scales — when we add operations, research, or other workstreams, the URL still works.
- SEO angle: can rank for "24/7 AI team," "hire AI team," "AI content team" etc.

## The Funnel

```
LinkedIn/X post ("I hired 3 AI employees for $200/month")
  |
  v
thelaunch.space/hire-your-24x7-team (THE PITCH)
  - Explains value in plain English
  - Shows what the team does (organic content & SEO)
  - Introduces agents as Pokemon/WWE stat cards
  - Shows REAL work from the last 7 days
  - Pricing: $200 POC, 4-week timeline
  - Primary CTA: "Start your team" / "Get started for $200"
  - Secondary CTA: "Watch them work live" → Launch Control
  |
  v
Two paths:
  A) Primary CTA → Lead capture / booking form
  B) Secondary CTA → /launch-control (hidden proof dashboard)
```

**Launch Control is no longer linked from the navbar.** It's discoverable only from the pitch page's secondary CTA or direct URL.

---

## Page Structure: `/hire-your-24x7-team`

This page scrolls. Mobile-first. LinkedIn audience clicks from phones.

### Section 1: Hook (above the fold)

**Headline options:**
- "Your SEO team that never clocks out"
- "Content marketing on autopilot. $200 to start."
- "3 AI employees. 24/7. $200/month."

**Subhead:** Frame the pain — you know you need organic content but don't have the team, time, or budget. These agents handle it end-to-end while you run your business.

**Mini-proof line:** "This week: [X] blog posts published, [Y] customer questions found, [Z] hours of work done. Zero human hours."

**Primary CTA button** right here in the fold.

### Section 2: How It Works (the workflow, not the agents)

Plain English. Business language. No agent names yet.

**"Here's what happens every day, automatically:"**

1. Your team scans Reddit, forums, and communities for questions your customers are asking
2. Those questions become research briefs — topics your blog should cover
3. SEO-optimized blog posts get written and published to your site
4. Every day. No prompting. No supervision.

Frame it as: "You wake up, there's a new blog post on your site targeting keywords your customers actually search for."

### Section 3: Meet Your Team (Pokemon/WWE stat cards)

**Design: Trading card style.** Each agent gets a card showing:

- **Portrait** (existing NBP avatars — these are already cool)
- **Plain-English job title** (not "Operations Orchestrator" — something like "The Manager")
- **Stats grid** (like a Pokemon card):
  - Pace: how many tasks/day
  - Intelligence: model tier (e.g., "Claude Opus 4.5" → framed as "Top 1% AI")
  - Hours saved: per week vs doing it manually
  - Skills: 2-3 keyword tags (e.g., "SEO writing," "research," "scheduling")
  - Cost equivalent: "Replaces a $5K/month content marketer"
- **"Last 7 days" mini-feed**: 3-5 recent outputs (blog titles published, questions found, briefs written)

**The three cards:**

| Card | Plain-English Title | Real Name | Key Stat |
|------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| The Manager | "Runs the show. Schedules, delegates, keeps everything on track." | Parthasarathi | Pace: orchestrates entire pipeline daily |
| The Scout | "Finds what your customers are asking, before your competitors do." | Vibhishana | Intelligence: scans communities + builds research briefs |
| The Writer | "Turns research into published blog posts. Every single day." | Vyasa | Output: X blogs/week, Y words published |

**Why trading cards work:**
- Scannable in 3 seconds
- Shareable — someone screenshots a card and posts it
- Makes AI agents feel tangible, like hiring a person with known strengths
- Replaces the current long-form agent profile pages (which are not scannable or "wow")

### Section 4: The 4-Week Timeline

Visual timeline (think: progress bar or numbered steps).

| Week | What Happens | Outcome |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Week 1: Setup** | We build your agent team. Define their KRAs, outcomes, and success metrics. Train them on your brand, your ICP, your industry context. | Your team knows your business as well as a new hire would after a month. |
| **Week 2: Trial Run** | Agents produce output every day. You see everything they do. Daily feedback loop with you. | You watch real content get created and published. Tweak the direction in real-time. |
| **Week 3: Iteration** | We incorporate your feedback. Agents get smarter about your voice, your audience, your standards. Continuous training. | The output starts feeling like *your* content, not generic AI slop. |
| **Week 4: Handoff** | Your system is running autonomously. We hand off documentation and maintenance guides. | You have a self-running content engine. Wake up to new blog posts. |

**Important framing note:** Don't say "hand off to teams" — ICP might be a solopreneur. Say "hand off to you" or "your team, if you have one." The point is: it runs on its own now.

### Section 5: Pricing

**Keep it dead simple.**

**The POC: $200/month**
- Full agent team setup and training
- 4-week structured engagement (the timeline above)
- Daily output visible to you
- Your agents learn your brand, ICP, and voice
- "If it doesn't work, you've risked the cost of one nice dinner."

**Optional: Growth Partnership — $1,000/month**
- After the POC, for founders who want ongoing strategic support
- Monthly strategy calls
- Agent optimization and scaling
- New workstream buildout (operations, research, etc.)
- "Like having a fractional AI operations lead"
- Frame against alternatives: "vs hiring a content marketer at $5K/month or an agency at $10K/month"

**Pricing psychology:** The $200 is the foot-in-the-door. Low enough to be an impulse decision for the ICP ($100K-$2M services business). The $1,000 is the real revenue, but it only converts after they've seen the POC work.

### Section 6: Primary CTA (conversion)

Big, clear. **"Get your AI team this week — $200"**

Leads to: minimal lead capture form:
- Company name
- Website URL
- "What's your biggest content challenge?" (dropdown: "Don't have time" / "Tried it, didn't work" / "Never started")

Then → Calendly booking link/embed for a call with Krishna. Form data routes to Make.com webhook so Krishna has context before the call.

### Section 7: Secondary — "See the proof" (optional scroll)

"Want to see this system running on our own site right now?"

**Secondary CTA:** "Watch the team work live →" → opens `/launch-control`

This is the only public entry point to Launch Control now.

### Section 8: Footer tease

"More workstreams coming soon: Operations Management, Automated Research, Programmable Tools."

Simple text. No cards. No "coming soon" badges. Just a mention that the platform grows.

## What Happens to Existing Pages

| Current | New State |
|---------|-----------|
| `/build-your-ai-team` | **Redirects to `/hire-your-24x7-team`**. Old URL becomes a 301 redirect. |
| `/build-your-ai-team/[agent]` (agent detail pages) | **Replaced by Pokemon cards on the pitch page.** If someone lands on the old URL, redirect to the pitch page with an anchor to the team section. Keep the route alive as a redirect for a few weeks, then remove. |
| `/launch-control` | **Still exists, but hidden.** Removed from navbar. Only accessible via the pitch page's secondary CTA or direct URL. |
| Navbar "Build Your AI Team" link | **Changes to "Hire Your 24/7 Team"** pointing to `/hire-your-24x7-team`. |
| Navbar "Launch Control" link | **Removed.** |

## Agent Card Design — Pokemon/WWE Style

### Inspiration
- Pokemon cards: stats grid, element type, HP bar, abilities list
- WWE trading cards: portrait, name, finishing move, stats
- FIFA Ultimate Team: player ratings, position, key attributes

### Card anatomy (per agent)

```

+-------------------------------------+
```

### Stats to show (per card)
- **Pace** — tasks per day, visualized as a bar
- **Intelligence** — model tier, framed in plain English ("Top-tier AI" not "Claude Opus 4.5")
- **Monthly savings** — dollar amount vs hiring a human for the same job
- **Skills** — 2-4 keyword tags
- **Last 7 days** — 2-3 concrete recent outputs (curated, not raw logs)

### Data source
- **All live from Convex.** One-time setup. Stats, scoreboard numbers, and "last 7 days" feeds all pull from the same Convex backend that powers Launch Control.
- Card stats (pace, savings) can use computed values from pipeline run data.
- "Last 7 days" mini-feed uses the same data as the Launch Control tabs, filtered to 7 days.

---

## Launch Control Changes

### Removed from public navigation
- No navbar link
- Only accessible via pitch page secondary CTA or direct URL
- Still fully functional for anyone who reaches it

### FTUE (from Session 1 — still valid)
When someone DOES reach Launch Control (via the pitch page CTA), they now have context. But FTUE labels are still valuable:

- "Questions" → "Customer questions found on Reddit"
- "Briefs" → "Research docs that turn questions into blog topics"
- "Blogs" → "Published SEO posts on your site"
- "Hours Saved" → "vs doing this manually"
- "Cost Saved" → "based on freelancer rates"
- Pipeline one-liner: "Your AI team runs this schedule every day, automatically."

**Decision: Make FTUE labels permanent.** Always helpful, never confusing. No localStorage tracking needed.

---

## Resolved Questions (Feb 16, Session 2)

### 1. Lead capture mechanics — RESOLVED
**Decision:** Minimal form → Calendly booking. Low friction.

Form fields:
- Company name
- Website
- "What's your biggest content challenge?" (dropdown: "Don't have time," "Tried it, didn't work," "Never started")

Then Calendly booking embed/link. Challenge-based question is empathetic — qualifies the lead without making "No" feel like disqualification.

When lead volume increases, add more friction/qualifying steps.

### 2. Live data — RESOLVED
**Decision:** Pull live from Convex. One-time setup. Live numbers are more impressive — if someone sees a count update while on the page, that's a mic-drop moment.

### 3. Pokemon card interaction — RESOLVED
**Decision:**
- **Desktop:** Cards flip (front = stats, back = "last 7 days" work feed) and can expand for more detail.
- **Mobile:** Cards stack vertically, thumb-scrollable. No flip — show all info inline or accordion-style.

### 4. CTA copy — RESOLVED
**Decision:** "Get your AI team this week — $200" direction. Anchors the price in the button, creates urgency with "this week."

### 5. Show real work — RESOLVED
**Decision:** Yes, aggressively. Show everything to signal confidence.

**On the pitch page:** Tabbed sections (mini Launch Control):
- **Questions tab:** Questions Vibhishana picked from Reddit
- **Briefs tab:** Research briefs
- **Blogs tab:** Published blog posts by Vyasa (linked to actual articles)

This is a full proof section, not just highlights. The ICP won't read every entry, but the *volume* signals "this is real and it's running."

---

## Launch Control Public View Changes

Separate from the pitch page — these are changes to what public (non-admin) visitors see when they reach `/launch-control` via the secondary CTA.

### Questions Tab (public view)
- **Show all questions openly.** They're Reddit-sourced, public data.
- **Hide/remove:** Relevance scores, internal dropdowns, any admin-only metadata.
- **Show:** Question text, source community, date found.

### Briefs Tab (public view)
- **Show 5 briefs in full.**
- **Blur/gate the rest.** "Want to see more? Book a call." or "Join the waitlist."
- Briefs are proprietary analysis — partial reveal creates value and curiosity.

### Blogs Tab (public view)
- **Show all freely.** They're already published on the site. Link to actual blog posts.

### Admin View
- **No changes.** Stays as-is with full data access.
