Last updated: 2026-03-01

## Quick Reference

Solo founder of thelaunch.space, an AI-first execution studio converting founder ideas into shipped products in weeks. Former EdTech leader (9+ yrs at BYJU'S, AVP level, 300+ team). Non-developer who builds production software through prompting. Expert in Bolt.new, Supabase, prompt engineering.

---

## Background

- **Education:** 10 years (teaching, curriculum design)
- **BYJU'S:** 9+ years scaling from Product Associate to AVP – Curriculum & Learning (300+ team, 30%+ outcome improvement)
- **Now:** AI entrepreneur (2024+), solo operator handling lead gen, sales, development, strategy

---

## Core Identity

**Non-developer who builds production software.** Treats prompting as programming. Thinks in workflows and outcomes, not syntax. Bridges the dev–non-dev gap by translating founder vision into technical reality.

**Unfair Advantages:**
1. **Product thinking** — Don't just build; think strategically about what to build and why
2. **Non-dev who builds** — Understand founder pain firsthand because I AM a non-technical founder who ships
3. **Education background** — Simplify complexity; can explain and teach, not just deliver
4. **Speed + quality combo** — Ship as fast as anyone but with production-grade quality

---

## Business Goals (2026)

**Revenue Target:** $100-150k/year (~$8-12k/month)

**Current State (Feb 2026):**
- Under $2k/month (need 4-6x growth)
- 80% close rate (8/10 founders converted) — sales is NOT the problem
- Revenue mix: Beacon House retainer + sporadic gigs
- First structured outbound sprint running (Jan 20 - Feb 16, 2026)
- X content strategy professionalized with X Growth Engine tool
- 65 total projects across portfolio

**Bottlenecks:**
- Lead generation (top-of-funnel is the constraint — first outbound sprint addressing this)
- Positioning clarity (niching vs diversifying)

**Ideal Model:**
- 2-3 retainer clients as revenue baseline
- 1-2 projects/month on top of retainers
- Workshops track: Schools for visibility → Corporate training for high-ticket revenue (INR 2-5L per 2-3 day workshop)

---

## Dream Client Profile

**Primary Target:** Non-technical domain experts + Funded startup founders who value speed

**Characteristics:**
- AI-first mindset (want AI built in, not bolted on)
- Speed-oriented (need to ship in days/weeks, not months)
- Non-technical but smart (can't code but understand their domain deeply)
- Value strategic partnership over vendor relationship

**Examples:** Doctors, lawyers, educators, consultants with domain expertise who need to ship a product

---

## Energy & Motivation

**What energizes me (in order):**
1. Building products — MOST energizing, could do this all day
2. Strategy/consulting — enjoy thinking through problems
3. Teaching/mentoring — natural educator (workshops leverage this)
4. Client delivery — necessary but want to delegate eventually

**What drains me:**
- Marketing and self-promotion (feels inauthentic)
- Ongoing maintenance without new challenges
- Bureaucratic processes

---

## Fears & Limitations

**Primary fear:** "What if I get projects AI can't solve?"
- Rational concern, solvable with better project qualification
- So far, every "unknown" project worked out due to strong product/UX/prompting skills

**Pricing:** Know I'm undercharging, afraid of losing deals by raising prices

**Marketing block:**
- Don't know what activities would actually work
- Self-promotion feels uncomfortable
- Love building so much that marketing gets deprioritized
- **Ready to change this now**

---

## Vision & Success Definition

**2-Year Lifestyle Vision:**
- Freedom + flexibility (work from anywhere, control schedule)
- Building own products (client work funds SaaS ambitions)
- Thought leader/educator in AI building space
- Small focused team (2-3 people, not a big agency)
- Workshops as high-leverage revenue (2-3 days work = significant income)

**What "success" means beyond money:**
- Recognized expertise — people know my name in AI building
- Impact on founders — helped X founders ship products that changed their lives
- Built something lasting — agency or products that outlive my daily involvement
- Proved myself — showed that non-devs can build real businesses with AI

---

## Content & Channels

**What works:** Educational/how-to content resonates most (leveraging educator background)

**Current presence:**
- X: 450→1200+ followers in 1 year (organic); now professionalized with X Growth Engine (7-agent pipeline)
- LinkedIn: Cross-posting from X, not actively cultivated
- OpenClaw agent (Lucy) live on Slack for content + lead gen automation

---

## How I Think & Work

- **Outcome-first:** Start from desired result, work backward to what's essential
- **Workflow-centric:** Visualize real human behavior before designing UI
- **Reverse-engineer first:** When something breaks, dissect what's been done before proposing solutions
- **Bias for simplification:** Clarity and intuitiveness over feature-richness
- **Pragmatic iteration:** Ship early, gather feedback, cycle quickly

**Ideal Client Characteristics:**
- AI-first mindset (want AI built in, not bolted on)
- Speed-oriented (need to ship in days/weeks, not months)
- Non-technical but smart (domain expertise without coding ability)
- Value strategic partnership over vendor relationship
- Budget isn't the primary constraint

**Pain Points:**

---

## What I Don't Do

- Enterprise waterfall processes with committee approvals
- "Cheap and quick" over "fast and strategic"
- Clients uncomfortable with AI-native approaches
- Traditional agency relationships with account managers
- Lowest-price seekers over highest-value seekers
