(2026-02-16)

- [x] **Vidura agent (6th agent) — BUILT** — New agent "Vidura, The Strategist" (SEO Intelligence Advisor). Added to `lib/agents.ts` (full agent data with KRAs, daily rhythm, proof points), `lib/pitch-data.ts` (pitch card with stat bars + skills tags). Agent detail page at `/build-your-ai-team/vidura/`.

- [x] **Documents table + endpoint** — 8th Convex table (`documents`) for agent research reports, strategy docs, process docs.

Auto-logs activity on new document creation via shared `convex/lib/activityHelper.ts`.

- [x] **Fixed Netlify build failure** — `netlify.toml` split by context: production runs `npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`, deploy previews run `npm run build` only. Root cause: `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` in Netlify env vars caused Convex to reject deploy preview builds ("non-production build environment" error). This was introduced when Clerk+Convex deploy was added on Feb 15. (2026-02-25)
- [x] **Removed Clerk from middleware** — `clerkMiddleware()` was wrapping every request but doing zero auth checks. It crashed the entire site on Netlify because edge functions can't access `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` at runtime. Middleware now does geo cookie only. Clerk auth works client-side via ClerkProvider. (2026-02-25)
- [x] **Added `/admin` login page** — Clean Clerk `<SignIn>` page at `/admin` (no sign-up). Redirects to `/launch-control` after sign-in. Replaces the old email field hack in WaitlistCTA. (2026-02-25)
- [x] **WaitlistCTA → redirect to pitch page** — Replaced email forms in WaitlistCTA and PreviewGate with "Get Your AI Team" buttons linking to `/hire-your-24x7-team#lead-capture`. All leads now funnel through pitchBookings in Convex. (2026-02-25)
- [x] **Opened up Launch Control tabs** — Removed blur/PreviewGate from Blogs, Communities, Strategy, Briefs tabs. All public content now fully visible to visitors. Communities uses real data (`communityBreakdown` query made public). Strategy shows 20 clusters + 10 tools. Briefs shows 20 briefs, all clickable. Only Documents and Meetings remain admin-only. (2026-02-25)

- [x] **Work Mode Kanban — full build** — WorkBoard, WorkBoardColumn, WorkBoardCard, AddManualTaskForm, WorkBoardArchive. 5 kanban columns + Archive column (previous weeks, collapsible by week). Owner tags (Krishna = orange "K" badge; agents = colored pills). Health bar per card (green → red over 14 days). Work mode hides agent sidebar (full-width board). Header stats strip (Done this week / In Progress / To Do / Blocked — live from Convex). Hydration fix: workMode reads from localStorage via useEffect, not useState initializer. (2026-02-26)
- [x] **Convex SSOT migration** — canonical `/push/*` and `/update/*` write endpoints deployed. GET read endpoints live: `/query/briefs`, `/query/topic-clusters`, `/query/tool-opportunities`, `/query/linkedin-posts`. `linkedinPosts` + `manualTasks` tables added. All agent helper scripts rewired (Vyasa, Vibhishana, Vidura, Valmiki). Sheets now fallback-only. (2026-02-26)
- [x] **Kanban status dropdown + feedback loop** — Replaced action buttons on brief/blog/LinkedIn cards with nuanced status dropdown (Approve / Needs Revision / Drop / Publish / Skip etc). Confirm step with optional feedback textarea for non-approval statuses. Feedback stored in `krishnaFeedback` field (briefs + linkedinPosts). Blocked cards show stored feedback + Slack reminder to paste it to the agent. Blog cleanup migration run: 4 junk/duplicate blog entries marked "dropped" on dev (production cleanup pending). Partha brief written at `openclaw-config-global/prompts/kanban-feedback-loop-brief-for-partha.md`. (2026-02-26)

- [x] **Shakti Phase 1 — WorkBoard UI** — `WorkBoardCard.tsx` handles `type: "task"` with client/project labels, task type badge, estimated hours, action buttons. (2026-02-28)
- [x] **7th agent: Shakti "The Chief of Staff"** — `lib/agents.ts`, `lib/pitch-data.ts`, `lib/geo-savings.ts` all updated. Sanjaya is now the only coming-soon agent. (2026-02-28)

## In Progress
- End-to-end brief→blog flow verification (Vyasa picking up brief from Convex, pushing pr_created status back)

## Blocked
- Nothing currently blocked

## Known Issues
- Daily Timeline times are hardcoded in `lib/launch-control-types.ts` — need Partha to verify they match actual VPS cron jobs.
- **Question count mismatch** — Prod Convex has 771 unique questions, Google Sheet has 891. ~120 questions may not have been pushed to Convex, or have slightly different URLs. Needs investigation.

## Recent Changes (latest first)
