## Parthasarathi

1024x1280 portrait. Semi-realistic digital illustration of a single young Indian man in his early 30s, solo subject. A warm, approachable employee portrait — like a "Meet the Team" headshot for the best operations manager you've ever had. Clean modern clothes — a well-fitted dark blue henley or simple crew neck, nothing flashy. Clean-shaven, short neat hair. Soft, natural smile with calm brown eyes that have an unusual depth to them — like he already knows what you're about to ask and has the answer ready. The kind of person who makes everyone around him feel like everything's handled.

The one magical quality: the light around him bends slightly warmer than it should, as if he's gently radiating calm. A barely-there golden-blue aura in the light hitting his face — not a glow effect, more like the air around him is slightly more serene than normal. The way Krishna on the chariot made chaos feel still. You can't quite name it, but you trust this person completely the moment you see him.

Background: clean, minimal, slightly warm — soft gradient or blurred workspace. Nothing distracting. The focus is entirely on his face and presence. Camera angle: eye level, straight on, gentle and direct. Warm key light from upper left, soft fill. Painterly but grounded — clearly a digital illustration, not a photo, but feels real.

## Sanjaya

1024x1280 portrait. Semi-realistic digital illustration of a single young Indian man in his late 20s, solo subject. A warm, approachable employee portrait — like a "Meet the Team" headshot for the sharpest scout on the team, the one who always finds the opportunity first. Clean modern clothes — a dark charcoal jacket over a simple amber-toned t-shirt, casual professional. Textured fade haircut, light stubble. Friendly expression but with notably sharp, perceptive eyes — not intimidating, just unusually observant. The person at dinner who notices the waiter before anyone else does. You'd want him scanning your market because nothing gets past him.

The one magical quality: his eyes catch light differently than a normal person's. There's a faint warm amber reflection in his irises that doesn't quite match the light source — like he's seeing something the rest of us can't. Sanjaya's divine sight, but rendered as just... eyes that see more. Not glowing, not sci-fi. Just a subtle amber clarity that makes you do a double-take. You'd swear he's looking at something behind you.

Background: clean, minimal, slightly warm — soft gradient or blurred workspace. Nothing distracting. The focus is entirely on his face and presence. Camera angle: slight low angle, giving him a confident, alert presence. Warm key light from upper left, soft fill. Painterly but grounded — clearly a digital illustration, not a photo, but feels real.

## Valmiki

1024x1280 portrait. Semi-realistic digital illustration of a single young Indian man in his early 30s, solo subject. A warm, approachable employee portrait — like a "Meet the Team" headshot for the content lead who writes things that actually move people. Clean modern clothes — a relaxed dark rose-toned button-up shirt, top button undone, sleeves casually rolled. Wavy medium-length hair pushed back naturally — slightly more expressive styling than the others, fitting for the creative on the team. Warm, open face with eyes that make you feel understood. The colleague who asks "how are you?" and actually listens. You'd trust him with your voice because he genuinely gets people.

The one magical quality: there's a softness to the light on his hands and around his mouth — as if the air near where he creates is slightly more alive. Not a glow. More like the warmth you feel near someone who's about to say exactly the right thing. Valmiki heard a bird die and the first poem in history came out of his grief — that depth of feeling shows in his eyes. There's an emotional intelligence in his portrait that feels almost supernatural. You look at him and think: this person will never write something hollow.

Background: clean, minimal, slightly warm — soft gradient or blurred workspace. Nothing distracting. The focus is entirely on his face and presence. Camera angle: eye level, gentle three-quarter angle, intimate and personal. Warm key light from upper left, soft fill. Painterly but grounded — clearly a digital illustration, not a photo, but feels real.

## Vibhishana

1024x1280 portrait. Semi-realistic digital illustration of a single young Indian man in his early 30s, solo subject. A warm, approachable employee portrait — like a "Meet the Team" headshot for the analyst who always tells you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. Clean modern clothes — a simple dark emerald green crew neck, clean and understated. Short neat hair, well-groomed. Calm, steady expression with clear honest eyes — no performance, no posturing. The person in the meeting who quietly says the one thing everyone was avoiding, and is always right. You'd want him on your side because his loyalty is to the truth, not to what's convenient.

The one magical quality: there's an unusual clarity to his gaze — his eyes are slightly more vivid and clear than feels normal, as if he literally sees through noise to what's real underneath. Not piercing or intense — just clear. Like looking into still water. Vibhishana stood in Ravana's court full of illusions and saw the truth plainly. That clarity lives in this portrait. You look at him and instinctively feel: this person cannot be fooled.

Background: clean, minimal, slightly warm — soft gradient or blurred workspace. Nothing distracting. The focus is entirely on his face and presence. Camera angle: eye level, straight on, direct and honest — matching his character. Warm key light from upper left, soft fill. Painterly but grounded — clearly a digital illustration, not a photo, but feels real.

## Vyasa

1024x1280 portrait. Semi-realistic digital illustration of a single young Indian man in his early 30s, solo subject. A warm, approachable employee portrait — like a "Meet the Team" headshot for the senior writer who turns complex ideas into content that just works. Clean modern clothes — a dark charcoal jacket over a muted purple crew neck, smart-casual. Short neatly trimmed beard — the only one of the five with facial hair, giving him a quiet gravitas. Wise, grounded expression with deep brown eyes that look like they've read everything. Slight nod and a gentle half-smile — the look of someone who just finished structuring a complicated topic and knows it's going to land. You'd want him writing for your business because he makes the complex feel inevitable.

The one magical quality: he looks slightly older than he is — not in wrinkles, but in depth. His eyes carry a weight of knowledge that doesn't match someone in their 30s. There's a faint warm light in the catchlights of his eyes, like there are pages being written somewhere behind them. Vyasa authored the longest epic ever told and organized the Vedas — that impossible depth of knowledge shows as a quiet, ageless wisdom in a young face. You look at him and think: this person understands things I haven't even asked about yet.

Background: clean, minimal, slightly warm — soft gradient or blurred workspace. Nothing distracting. The focus is entirely on his face and presence. Camera angle: from very slightly above eye level — the subtle feeling of looking at a teacher. Warm key light from upper left, soft fill. Painterly but grounded — clearly a digital illustration, not a photo, but feels real.
